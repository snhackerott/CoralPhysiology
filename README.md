# Coral Physiology
Example data and scripts to quantify metrics of coral host and symbiont physiology

### Surface Area
Surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>) is quantified via wax dipping. First, a standard curve is created from wax dipping wooden cylinders of a known surface area. The equation of this line is applied to calculate surface area of coral samples from the difference in weight gained following a single wax dip.

### Chlorophyll Concentration
The concentration of chlorophyll (μg/cm<sup>2</sup>) is quantified via spectrophotometry. The absorbance of chlorophyll extractions in 100% acetone at 630nm, 663nm, and 750nm are standardized to the pathlength of the plate reader (Warren 2008) and utilized in the equations from Jeffrey and Humphrey 1975. The total amount of chlorophyll (μg) is calculated based on the total airbrushed slurry volume and then standardized to coral surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>).

### Protein Concentration 
The concentration of protein (μg/cm<sup>2</sup>) is quantified via spectrophotometry and a commercial kit. First, a standard curve is created from the absorbance of the protein reaction of Standards at 562nm. The best-fit equation is then applied to calculate the concentration of protein (μg/ml) of each sample. The total amount of protein (μg) is calculated based on the total airbrushed slurry volume and then standardized to coral surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>).

### Biomass
Biomass is quantified as Ash Free Dry Weight. The difference in dried weight (g) following burning in a muffle furnace is standardized to total airbrushed slurry volume and then to coral surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>).
